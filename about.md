I'm a PhD student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington.  Before that, I was a senior machine learning engineer at Siri.  I received my BA in Linguistics and Computer Science from the University of Chicago in 2016.  

A few of my interests are representation learning for text, latent structure models, and multilingual NLP.  I am broadly interested in how what we understand about language can inform modeling techniques and vice versa.
