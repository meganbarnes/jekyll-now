I studied linguistics and computer science at the University of Chicago.  I completed my BA in 2016.    
    
I'm interested in what computational models can tell us about ourselves.  I'm passionate about language and data.  My focus is natural language processing, but I'm jazzed about any and all ways to draw meaningful conclusions about humans from data.
