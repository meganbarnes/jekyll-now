I studied linguistics and computer science at the University of Chicago.  I completed my BA in 2016.    
    
I'm interested in what computational models can tell us about ourselves.  I'm passionate about language and data.  My focus is natural language processing, but I'm jazzed about any and all ways to draw meaningful conclusions about humans from data. 

### Professional Interests

Natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical models, prediction algorithms, corpus analytics, speech recognition and analysis, data visualization.

### Other Interests

Making cool things, music, linguistic theory, iced coffee, intersectional feminism, twitter, logic, comedy
