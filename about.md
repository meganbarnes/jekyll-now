I am completing my fourth year of undergrad at the University of Chicago, studying linguistics and computer science.    
    
I'm interested in the intersection of computers and people.  I'm passionate about data - organized beautifully and used to better understand humans and how they work.  My focus is natural language processing, but I'm jazzed about any and all ways to draw meaningful conclusions about humans from data.   


### Professional Interests

Natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical models, prediction algorithms, corpus analytics, speech recognition and analysis, data visualization.

### Other Interests

Making cool things, music (choral for performing, hip hop for listening), linguistic theory, iced coffee, intersectional feminism, twitter, logic, comedy
