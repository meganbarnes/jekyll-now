I work for Knowledge Lab, part of the Computation Institute through The University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.  At Knowledge Lab, I am working on a project to create maps of research activity in key topical areas of interest to research funding agencies. The maps could reveal and help funders analyze a) levels of research activity, b) who is participating, c) and in which topics.
